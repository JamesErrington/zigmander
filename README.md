A Zig library for command-line interfaces. Inspired by [commander](https://github.com/tj/commander.js) and [zig-clap](https://github.com/Hejsil/zig-clap), as well as other similar projects like [clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) and [yazap](https://github.com/prajwalch/yazap).

Written very much as a learning exercise. This is not expected to be anywhere near production ready code!
